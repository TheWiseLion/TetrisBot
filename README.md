Bot is based ocr. Program utilized a simple hueristic based on maximizing completed lines and minimizing the max height to choose potential moves. 

Uses .Net framework to directly load the the facebook app and grab the screen image directly from memory.

Unfortunately tetris friends is no longer around. And the bot was powered on ocr so it's no longer very useful.
